# Peco

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/peco)](https://npmjs.com/peco) [![circleci](https://badgen.net/circleci/github/uchudenpa/peco/master)](https://circleci.com/gh/uchudenpa/peco) ![status](https://badgen.net/badge/status/beta/pink)

## What is this?

Peco is a static website generator powered by modern web tooling, like webpack and Vue.js. It generates static HTML files and assets at build time, once the generated website is loaded on the client-side, it runs as an SPA.

## How is it?

It is good. I don't think I'll ever use Hexo again.

## Installation

It's recommended to install peco locally in your project:

```bash
cd your-project
yarn add peco
```

## How to use?

Let me explain how to use it in 20 words:

- `source/*.md` is your pages
- `source/_posts/*.md` is your posts
- `peco dev [directory]` to run it
- `peco build [directory]` to build it

For details please check out the [docs](https://peco.upa.sh), please not that the documentation is still work-in-progress.
